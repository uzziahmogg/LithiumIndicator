☐ create func CheckElementarySignal
☐ make code for CheckComplexSignals
☐ move long/short checking signals to diferent branch
☐ remake all error handling to exceptions in functional programming
☐ make 3-candle cross event fucntion
☐ make candle+count itterator in separate States structure
☐ remove all chart labels keep only last 30
☐ remove all prices and inds array, kepp only last three
☐ recode SetInitValues and PrintDebugSummary to cycles over all pairs
☐ check DataExist for functions
☐ make shift uturn slow and fast lines

move error checking data checking args checking from signal functions to lowest event functions
--
if function make something - return number maked things, or 0 if nothing todo, or nil if error
if function return something - if success return string or number or boolean or if error/todo nothing return nil
rememebr about strength critery in prciecross/osccross signals - now there have most strength criter where different sides of cross have different not equal values

events -> signals -> states -> enters
events/conditions is elementary signals like fast oscilator cross up slow oscilator, price cross up ma  and all there are in period 2-3 candles
several events and conditions consist signal like uturn, spring, cross, cross50 etc
functions responsible for cantching signals counting requested events and conditions
several signals consist states like trend, impulse etc
several states and signals consist enters like Leg1ZigZagSpring, Uturn50 etc
signals is cleat signals , all streng conditions must be in states/enters
